The Lisp-Stat system is an umbrella for a few projects and provides a unified interface for working with statistics.  The general rule is that Lisp-Stat may depend on other libraries, for example data-frame, but not the other way around.  Lisp-Stat provides it's own user package, LS-USER, which imports CL as well as the symbols we need from the other libraries.  You should always do your work in the LS-USER package, and not in CL-USER.
